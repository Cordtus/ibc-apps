**Perspective**: Golang expert unfamiliar with Cosmos SDK, Tendermint, or IBC
**Focus**: Practical implementation requirements for IBC-go v8 compatibility
**Source**: Analysis of middleware research data collected 2025-08-25

## Overview Questions

### Version Compatibility Matrix
**CRITICAL**: The research shows mixed IBC-go versions (v8.0.0, v8.6.1, v10.1.1) across modules. For v8 implementation:

1. **Which specific v8 version should be targeted?** (v8.0.0 vs v8.6.1 vs latest v8.x?)
2. **Are there breaking changes between v8 minor versions?** (async-icq uses v8.0.0, ibc-hooks uses v8.6.1)
3. **What are the migration paths from v8 to v10?** The research shows newer modules use v10
4. **Can v8 and v10 middleware coexist in the same application?**

### Interface logic
**UNCLEAR**: Multiple interface types mentioned without clear definitions:

5. **What is the `porttypes.IBCModule` interface contract?** All middleware implement this
6. **What is the `IBCMiddleware` interface vs `IBCModule`?** Used interchangeably in examples
7. **What is `ICS4Middleware` and how does it differ from `IBCMiddleware`?** (ibc-hooks uses both)
8. **What methods must be implemented for each interface?** No interface definitions provided

## Middleware-Specific Questions

### Rate Limiting Module
**Pattern**: `ratelimit.NewIBCMiddleware(app.RatelimitKeeper, transferStack)`

9. **What is a "Keeper" in Golang terms?** Appears to be dependency injection pattern
10. **What interface must `RatelimitKeeper` implement?** No keeper interface shown
11. **What is `transferStack` parameter type?** Appears to be another IBCModule
12. **How does the "wrapping" mechanism work at runtime?** Rate limiting "wraps transfer module"
13. **What is `BeginBlock` handler and when is it called?** Mentioned for epoch management
14. **What are "store keys" and how do they relate to data persistence?** `["ratelimit"]` specified

### Packet Forward Middleware  
**Pattern**: `packetforward.NewIBCMiddleware(app, k, retriesOnTimeout, forwardTimeout)`

17. **What are valid values for `retriesOnTimeout uint8`?** No configuration guidance
18. **What is appropriate `forwardTimeout time.Duration`?** No defaults provided
19. **What does "can wrap any IBC module" mean practically?** vs rate limiting which "wraps transfer"
20. **How do migrations work?** `has_migrations: true` but no migration code shown

25. **What is the execution order between ICS4 and IBC middleware?** Critical for understanding flow
26. **How do wasm contracts get executed?** Integration with external wasm module unclear

### Async ICQ Module
**Pattern**: `icq.NewIBCModule(app.ICQKeeper)` + `ibcRouter.AddRoute(icqtypes.ModuleName, icqModule)`

27. **What is `ibcRouter` and how do you obtain it?** Not shown in other modules
28. **Why is async-icq a module vs middleware?** Research notes this distinction
29. **What is the difference between modules and middleware at runtime?** Architectural question
30. **How do you register IBC modules vs middleware?** Different registration logic shown

## Implementation Architecture Questions

### Stack Configuration
40. **How do you determine the correct middleware stacking order?** Order affects behavior
41. **What happens when middleware chain breaks?** Error propagation through stack
42. **Can middleware be hot-swapped or reconfigured?** Runtime reconfiguration support
43. **How do you debug issues in a middleware stack?** Observability through layers

### Testing Architecture  
44. **What is "SimApp" and how do you create one?** Referenced in all integration tests
45. **How do you mock IBCModule interfaces for unit testing?** Dependency isolation
46. **What is the "interchain test framework"?** E2E testing mechanism unclear

- Concrete examples of keeper implementations  
- Step-by-step initialization sequences
- Error handling logic and error types

### Nice-to-Have Information
- Performance benchmarks and scaling characteristics
- Production deployment logic
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Advanced configuration options

## Recommendations for Research Agent

1. **Prioritize v8-specific examples** - Current research mixes v8 and v10 implementations
2. **Include interface definitions** - Critical missing piece for implementation
3. **Document initialization sequences** - Step-by-step implementation guides needed
4. **Show concrete keeper implementations** - Abstract pattern not sufficient
5. **Include error handling examples** - Production readiness requirement
6. **Add performance considerations** - Scaling and resource usage guidance
7. **Document testing setup requirements** - Practical development environment needs

## Implementation Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK**: 
- Interface compatibility between versions
- Dependency injection complexity  
- State management and migration
- Middleware stacking order

**MEDIUM RISK**:
- Configuration management
- Error handling logic
- Testing setup complexity

**LOW RISK**:
- Basic Golang logic
- Standard library usage
- File organization

**Next Steps**: Focus research on v8-specific implementations with complete interface definitions and concrete examples rather than abstract logic.
