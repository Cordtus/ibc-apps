### Debugging and Monitoring (from v8 questions)
1. **Middleware stack debugging**: How to trace requests through multiple middleware layers?
2. **Production monitoring setup**: What metrics and alerts are essential for production?
3. **Distributed tracing support**: How to implement distributed tracing across IBC hops?

## Governance and Configuration

### Runtime Configuration (from v10 questions)
1. **Hot-swapping middleware**: Can middleware be reconfigured without chain restart?
2. **Parameter validation logic**: How are configuration parameters validated at runtime?
3. **Governance parameter updates**: How do governance proposals update middleware parameters?

## Architecture Decisions

### Design Patterns (from v7 questions)
1. **Empty interface usage**: How is type safety maintained with `interface{}` in packet data?
2. **Struct copying vs pointers**: What are the performance trade-offs in middleware design?
3. **Error wrapping strategies**: What is the standard pattern for error propagation through middleware?

### Module vs Middleware (from v8 questions)
1. **Classification criteria**: What determines if functionality should be a module vs middleware?
2. **Router registration differences**: How does module registration differ from middleware wrapping?

## CosmWasm Integration

### Wasm-Specific (from hooks questions)
1. **Contract execution flow**: How are CosmWasm contracts invoked from IBC hooks?
2. **Gas management for contracts**: How is gas allocated between middleware and contract execution?
3. **Contract upgrade impacts**: How do contract upgrades affect middleware behavior?

## Production Deployment

### Scaling Considerations (from v8 questions)
1. **Horizontal scaling patterns**: How to scale IBC middleware across multiple nodes?
2. **Rate limiting at scale**: How to implement distributed rate limiting?
3. **Connection pooling**: Best practices for managing IBC connections at scale?

### Security Considerations
1. **Packet validation patterns**: What additional validation should middleware implement?
2. **DoS prevention**: How to protect middleware from malicious packets?
3. **Key management**: How are signing keys managed in production middleware?

## Notes

These questions represent advanced topics that typically require:
- Production operational experience
- Specific migration experience between major versions
- Deep CosmWasm/Wasm knowledge
- Infrastructure and DevOps expertise

For most middleware implementations, the answered questions in [sdk-integration-answers.md](./sdk-integration-answers.md) combined with the existing documentation should be sufficient. These remaining questions become relevant for:
- Production deployments at scale
- Complex cross-chain contract interactions
- Major version migrations
- Performance-critical applications
